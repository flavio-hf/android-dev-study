// consider this: «fun main(args : Array<String>)», it's taught this way at SoloLearn and though either Intellij IDEA or VS Code find any problem, it doesn't run on terminal and on Kotlin playground. I couldn't run the program without it either on terminal, but it worked on Playground. The error presented says that main never takes arguments.
fun main() {
    println("'Sup, Android? \n I'm coming for you!")
    // data types max values calls
    println(Int.MAX_VALUE)
    println(Byte.MAX_VALUE)
    println(Double.MAX_VALUE)
    println(Float.MAX_VALUE)
}
